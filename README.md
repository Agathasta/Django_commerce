# COMMERCE

## [CS50 Web Design Project 2](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/2/commerce/)

Design an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that will allow users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a “watchlist.”

TECHNOLOGIES USED

* HTML
* CSS
* DJANGO

What I learned:  
- To start a README at the beginning of a project, I didn't this time and now I only remember I struggled, but not the million reasons why I did.
- To make a plan BEFORE I start. I'm not sure I'm happy with my models.
- To draw a design BEFORE I start, improvising CSS became a nightmare as more pages were added, and at some point I kind of gave up.
- And a ton of Django, and a ton of CSS :)
